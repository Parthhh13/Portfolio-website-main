              Proficient in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision,
              I've honed my skills in both building intelligent models and deploying 
              them at scale. My expertise extends to full-stack development (React, Flask, Node.js)
              and DevOps (Docker, CI/CD), enabling me to take AI solutions from concept to production 
              seamlessly. With a hands-on approach, I've worked on real-world projects that solve complex 
              problems and create tangible value.
